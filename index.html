    <p>Home Renovation Systems (HRS)is a company that specializes in bathroom and kitchen renovation.</p>
    <p>HRS's story starts May of 2007 in Phoenix Arizona.</p>
    <p>
      Founders Emily and Joe Herold took contract work from friends and family to make upgrades to their bathrooms and kitchen.
      Eventually they concluded that their services would be besides those close to them. And so they set up shop at 901 S. Sedona Way, Scottsdale, Arizona where
      folks in the Phoenix area can get the chance to change their bathroooms and kitchen.</p>
    <p>
      But they don't stop there, they have opened new locations in several places years 
      after the Phoenix headquarters. They now have four more locations in Scottsdale, Arizona, Tuscon, Arizona, Las Vegas, Nevada, and Albuquerque, New Mexico.
